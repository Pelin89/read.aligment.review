DNA alignment tools are tested in terms of robustness.
For this purpose tools are run with different version of reads.
Those different versions consist of:
 - original version
 - reads ordered alphabetically
 - reads shuffled randomly
 - reads reverse complemented

Bam files produced by the tools with the aferomentined read versions 
are used to produce some statistics, in order to compare tools in terms of robustness.
